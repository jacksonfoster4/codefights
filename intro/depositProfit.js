/*
You have deposited a specific amount of dollars into your bank account. Each year 
your balance increases at the same growth rate. Find out how long it would take for 
your balance to pass a specific threshold with the assumption that you don't make 
any additional deposits.

Example

For deposit = 100, rate = 20 and threshold = 170, the output should be
depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) = 3.

function depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) {
    let i = 0;
    while(deposit < threshold){
          deposit += (deposit *(rate/100))
          i++
    }
    return i
